# GithubWarmup

First I created the repo in Github. I copied the address to my clipboard, then I used the commands below to copy the repo on my machine. I have used git before so I already have a key pair set up.
```console
ssh-add ~/desktop/key
git clone git@github.com:dpgranger8/GithubWarmup.git
```
